**Context:**
Saint-Petersburg Pediatric University provides hospitalization data for the period 2019-2023 to define factors that impact the speed of patient's admission to the hospital and run Ad-hoc study on information that may be useful.
**Project goal:**
Define factors that impact the lag between referral and admission dates.

**Conclusions:**
1) Data explored and prepared
2) Data discovery performed
3) Correlation between factors is calculated
4) Statistical hypotheses tested:
  Mean lag between referral and admission dates 
   -for region "Ленинградская область" and others are not equal Lag between referral and admission dates for patients from region "Ленинградская область" is lower.
   -for billing party "ОМС" and others are not equal. Lag between referral and admission dates for the billing party "ОМС" is higher.
   -for planned and emergency admissions are not equal. Lag between referral and admission dates for emergency admissions is lower.
   -for department "Педиатрия 3" and others are not equal. Lag between referral and admission dates for department "Педиатрия 3" is lower.
   -for diagnoses with the number of patients over 100 and others are statistically equal. Lag between referral and admission dates for diagnoses with a number of patients over 100 is equal to less popular diagnoses.

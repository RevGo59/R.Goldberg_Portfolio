**Recommendations based on Coffee shop opening exploration:**
1. Central area should not be considered as a good place to open a new coffee shop since despite the high passability, the competition and rent are relatively too high.
2. 24/7 opening hours should not be considered for the coffee shop, but morning hours seem to be crucial.
3. The following areas should be considered:
 - Western area, since the price for a cup of coffee is the highest here, but at the same time average rating seems to be the lowest among all areas. Thus opening the coffee shop in this area the price for a cup of coffee should be set at 180 and pay attention to drinks and service quality.
 - South-Western area, since the price for a cup of coffee is relatively high, the share of coffee shop is just 13%. The main advantage could be the price of coffee cup - close to average (175), which should be less than average for the area.
 4. Location should be near to the subway, big transport hubs and business centers.
